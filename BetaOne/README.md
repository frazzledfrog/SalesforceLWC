### üõ† Technical Implementation

#### **Data Sources**
- Primary data source: `Master_LOS__c` custom object
- Real-time data aggregation with SOQL queries
- Support for regional data filtering and date range queries

#### **Frontend Technologies**
- Lightning Web Components (LWC) framework
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Responsive CSS with modern design patterns
- Component state management and lifecycle handling

#### **Testing Coverage**
- Comprehensive Apex test classes for all controllers and services
- Test coverage includes:
  - `DealerWatchlistControllerTest`
  - `GeminiApiServiceTest`
  - `SalesDataServiceTest`
  - `TopDealersControllerTest`
  - `UserComponentPreferenceServiceTest`

#### **Development Tools**
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Prettier code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks
- Jest testing framework for LWC components
- SFDX CLI integration

### üìä Key Metrics & Features
- **Rolling Period Analysis**: 120-day rolling window for performance tracking
- **Regional Support**: National, Ontario, Alberta, Quebec, Atlantic, Western regions
- **Year-over-Year Comparisons**: Historical performance analysis
- **Real-time Data**: Live data updates and synchronization
- **User Preferences**: Persistent component state across sessions

### üîß Configuration Requirements
- Salesforce DX project structure
- Custom object `Master_LOS__c` with required fields
- Lightning Platform environment
- Chart.js static resource (for monthly goal component)
- Proper org permissions for Apex classes and LWC components

### üöÄ Deployment Notes
- All components are production-ready except Gemini AI integration
- Requires proper field-level security configuration
- Custom object and field permissions must be configured
- Static resources need to be deployed for chart functionality

### üìù Known Limitations
- Gemini AI component requires external API configuration
- Limited to predefined regional categories
- Hardcoded 120-day rolling period (configurable in future releases)
- Requires manual Account-to-Dealer name mapping setup

## TypeScript Support (Added)

The repository is configured for optional TypeScript in LWC components.

What was added:
* `tsconfig.json` with strict type checking (noEmit) so TS acts as a type layer.
* Dev deps: `typescript`, `@types/node`, `@types/jest`.
* Scripts: `npm run typecheck` (TS), `npm run lint:ts` (JS + TS).
* ESLint config extended to handle `.ts` files via `.eslintrc.cjs`.
* Ambient types file `force-app/main/default/lwc/global.d.ts` for custom / Apex module typings.

How to migrate a component:
1. Rename `<component>.js` to `<component>.ts` (keep the HTML & meta XML unchanged).
2. Fix any type errors reported by `npm run typecheck`.
3. (Interim) If a deployment requires a `.js`, create a thin JS re-export:
  ```js
  import C from './myComponent';
  export default C;
  ```
  (Salesforce currently only processes `.js` source. Full TS transpile step can be added later.)

Utility tips:
* Put shared interfaces/types in `global.d.ts` or a `types/` folder with `*.d.ts` files.
* Use union types & optional chaining to eliminate many runtime guards.
* Add specific Apex method type declarations to improve IntelliSense.

Future enhancement option:
Add a build step (e.g., using `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly` + a simple copy or Rollup) to auto-generate the `.js` counterparts so manual re-export files aren‚Äôt needed.
